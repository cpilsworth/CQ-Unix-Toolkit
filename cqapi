Usage: `basename $0` [OPTION...]
CQ UNIX Toolkit API command.
Version `cat $DIR/VERSION`

Examples:
  cqapi -u admin                 # Provides username to connect to CQ
  cqapi -i http://localhost:5510 # Provided instance URL to connect to CQ
                                 # on local machine  on port 5510
  cqapi -p secret                # Provides password: secret to connect to
                                 # CQ
  cqapi -c                       # Get curl binary path
  cqapi -P -u admin              # Enable parse mode for common arguments
  cqapi -C 2                     # Get curl error for exit code: 2
  cqapi -H 401                   # Get HTTP textual error for HTTP 401 error
                                 # code
  cqapi -E                       # Extract exception message from stdin
  cqapi -e                       # Detect if on stdin there is exception
  cqapi -v                       # Returns toolkit version


Options:

  -u                    Use specified usernamed for connection
  -p                    Use provided password for authentication
  -i                    Use specified instance URL to connect
  -c                    Print on stdout curl binary path
  -P                    Enable parse mode for API common arguments. This must
                        be first parameter.
  -C                    Get curl friendly error for specified exit code.
  -H                    Get HTTP friendly error response instead of code
  -E                    Return on stdout only exception message skipping
                        stack trace at the same time
  -e                    Detect if on stdin thereis exception stacktrace
  -v                    Provides toolkit version

	1 Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this protocol.
	2 Failed to initialize.
	3 URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.
	4 A feature or option that was needed to perform the desired request was not enabled or was explicitly disabled at build-time. To make curl able to do this, you probably need another build of libcurl!
	5 Couldn't resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be resolved.
	6 Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.
	7 Failed to connect to host.
	8 FTP weird server reply. The server sent data curl couldn't parse.
	9 FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied access to the particular resource or directory you wanted to reach. Most often you tried to change to a directory that doesn't exist on the server.
	11 FTP weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASS request.
	13 FTP weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASV request.
	14 FTP weird 227 format. Curl couldn't parse the 227-line the server sent.
	15 FTP can't get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got in the 227-line.
	17 FTP couldn't set binary. Couldn't change transfer method to binary.
	18 Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.
	19 FTP couldn't download/access the given file, the RETR (or similar) command failed.
	21 FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.
	22 HTTP page not retrieved. The requested url was not found or returned another error with the HTTP error code being 400 or above. This return code only appears if -f, --fail is used.
	23 Write error. Curl couldn't write data to a local filesystem or similar.
	25 FTP couldn't STOR file. The server denied the STOR operation, used for FTP uploading.
	26 Read error. Various reading problems.
	27 Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed.
	28 Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached according to the condi‐ tions.
	30 FTP PORT failed. The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers support the PORT command, try doing a transfer using PASV instead!
	31 FTP couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command is used for resumed FTP transfers.
	33 HTTP range error. The range "command" didn't work.
	34 HTTP post error. Internal post-request generation error.
	35 SSL connect error. The SSL handshaking failed.
	36 FTP bad download resume. Couldn't continue an earlier aborted download.
	37 FILE couldn't read file. Failed to open the file. Permissions?
	38 LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind operation failed.
	39 LDAP search failed.
	41 Function not found. A required LDAP function was not found.
	42 Aborted by callback. An application told curl to abort the operation.
	43 Internal error. A function was called with a bad parameter.
	45 Interface error. A specified outgoing interface could not be used.
	47 Too many redirects. When following redirects, curl hit the maximum amount.
	48 Unknown option specified to libcurl. This indicates that you passed a weird option to curl that was passed on to libcurl and rejected. Read up in the manual!
	49 Malformed telnet option.
	51 The peer's SSL certificate or SSH MD5 fingerprint was not OK.
	52 The server didn't reply anything, which here is considered an error.
	53 SSL crypto engine not found.
	54 Cannot set SSL crypto engine as default.
	55 Failed sending network data.
	56 Failure in receiving network data.
	58 Problem with the local certificate.
	59 Couldn't use specified SSL cipher.
	60 Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates.
	61 Unrecognized transfer encoding.
	62 Invalid LDAP URL.
	63 Maximum file size exceeded.
	64 Requested FTP SSL level failed.
	65 Sending the data requires a rewind that failed.
	66 Failed to initialise SSL Engine.
	67 The user name, password, or similar was not accepted and curl failed to log in.
	68 File not found on TFTP server.
	69 Permission problem on TFTP server.
	70 Out of disk space on TFTP server.
	71 Illegal TFTP operation.
	72 Unknown TFTP transfer ID.
	73 File already exists (TFTP).
